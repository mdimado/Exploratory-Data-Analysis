# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Journey

This repository is my learning playground for mastering **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. It documents my progress, experiments, and insights as I dive deep into the world of data.

## What is EDA?

EDA is a form of a step/approach which is used to analyze datasets so that we can get some insights out of it (visuals) and to obtain confidence in a data to an extent where we are ready to engage a machine learning model.

EDA helps us in finding the errors, dscovering data, mapping out data structure and finding out anomalies
