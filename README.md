# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Journey

This repository is my learning playground for mastering **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. It documents my progress, experiments, and insights as I dive deep into the world of data.

## What is EDA?

EDA is a form of a step/approach which is used to analyze datasets so that we can get some insights out of it (visuals) and to obtain confidence in a data to an extent where we are ready to engage a machine learning model.

EDA helps us in finding the errors, dscovering data, mapping out data structure and finding out anomalies

## Visualization
visualization is the presentation of the data in the graphical or visual form to understand the data more clearly.
- Easily understand the features of the data
- Easily analyze the data and summarize it
- Help to get meaningful insights from the data
- Help to find the trend or pattern of the data

## Steps involved in EDA
1. ### Data Sourcing:
- The process of gathering data from multiple sources as external or internal data collection

- **Data Transformation**: Normalize, encode, and transform data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visualizations to spot trends and patterns.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize data using measures like mean, median, etc.
- **Detecting Patterns**: Identify relationships and emerging trends.
- **Handling Outliers**: Methods to identify and address outliers.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore feature dependencies and relationships.
- **Initial Modeling**: Experiment with simple models and hypotheses.
